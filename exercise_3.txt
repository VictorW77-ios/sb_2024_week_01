Statue of Liberty = 305ft 
Earth to Moon = 384.4 Mm 

First I need to set equal units of distance. To do this, I convert Megameters to feet. 

[Mm to ft] 
384.4 Mm -> 384.4 x 10^6 m 

(384.4 x 10^6) x (3,281 ft) = 1,261 x 10^12 ft 
So, the distance from the earth to the moon in terms of feet is 1,261 x 10^12 ft


Take that distance and divide it by the height of the Statue of Liberty:
1,261 x 10^12 / 305ft 
= 4.134 x 10^9 
= The amount of times the Statue can fit between the earth and the moon
