I was a little rusty with logs and bases when we covered them during the session, so I did a simple exercise to bridge the gap: 

Solve log_2(x+3) + log_2(x−2)=4 

1. I first used product rule (which required revisiting logarithm rules) to combine the logs since they have the same base
- log_2((x+3)(x−2))=4 

2. Given base 2, I then exponentiate each side
- (x+3)(x-2) = 2^4 [or 16]

3. Then I can expand the equation, simplifying it
- x^2 - 2x + 3x - 6 = 16 
-> x^2 + x - 6 = 16

4. Move all to one side (this allows me to get a quadratic equation in order to factor the equation later to find x)
- x^2 + x - 6 = 16
- Set equal to 0 -> x^2 + x - (6 - 16) = 0
- x^2 + x - 22 = 0 

5. Factor the equation
- This gives me (x-3)(x+6) = 0, so x = 3, or  x = -6 
To find the value of x in this case, I'll have to check the solution. However, I know that logs have undefined behavior with negative numbers, so I only checked x = 3. 
- log_2(3+3) + log_2(3-2) = 4
- log_2(6) + log_2(1) = 4
- log_2(6) + 0 = 4
- log_2(6) = 4 
Which checks out, so I know the solution is x = 3.
