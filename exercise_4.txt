Converting microseconds to relatable human terms 

[5.432e14 usec to seconds]

5.432e14 usec = 5.432e14 seconds

[Now, I convert those seconds to days. Converting down to the second of each minute is necessary in order to have equal units of time]

5.432e14 / ((24 hours in a day)(60 minutes in each hour)(60 seconds in each minute))
= 6.291e9 days OR 6,291,000,000,000 days
